##### pre-requisites for running this program.
- In order to run this program you must have nodejs installed and your own google search json api key which can be obtained for free from the google api library.
- Once you have your api key, navigate to server/app.js line:98 and insert your own api key in place of `<ADD-API-KEY-HERE>`.
- Optional: If you wish to have a functioning return-home button then go to client/result.html, line 14: and add the url you are running client/index.html from to the anchor tag href `<a href="<INSERT-URL-HERE>" alt="link-to-homepage">`

To install the dependencies required to run the project please navigate to the server folder and install the required dependencies (into the server folder, preferably using npm):
